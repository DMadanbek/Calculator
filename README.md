#Calculator 
it was hard project for me, my calculator dont work perfectly, for example operation pow(round(5.7), sqrt(16)) + (10 % 3) * 2 he output 46656, but the correct answer its 1298, the issue in toRPN, but i tired and i dont know how to solve this issue
otherwise another operations calculator solves correctly and i am happy about it, it was very hard and interesting project :)

#Interface 
i add four options, when calculator starts its ask you what you want, and you need to choose operation, i guess its easier to eyes
